TuBely presents a unique television watching experience revolving
around real life social interaction, with recommendations based on
these situational factors.  Inspired by models from movies and
internet radio, TuBely pulls together components of each to create a
more social, tailored recommendation system.  With your WatchBox,
TuBely provides a unique playlist experience different than existing
tv providers.  TuBely also introduces the idea of situational
recommendations, noting not only what viewers watch with their
friends, but also the time and location of the watching.

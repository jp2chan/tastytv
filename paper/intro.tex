\section{Introduction}

A lot of emphasis in social television is put on the virtual social
aspect.  A lot of viewer interaction is online, via twitter, facebook,
blogs, or virtual viewing rooms.  However, the level and personal
depth of this social interaction is often questionable.  {\sys} aims
to increase viewer’s real life social interaction.  By making viewing
suggestions based on the viewer and who they are physically with, this
system aims to reduce fights over the television remote, while using
this information to create more informative suggestions.

Taking into account the time, location, and shows that you watch with
your friends, {\sys} makes smarter, situational suggestions.  In
addition, {\sys} pulls from the Pandora tagging model to offer more
specialized categories of shows, so that the user can choose what kind
of show that they’re in the mood for.  Borrowing from internet radio’s
“currently listening” queue model, {\sys} has a queue of the shows
you’re currently watching, but allows the viewer to throw shows that
they’re generally interested in into their WatchBox.

\section{Introduction}

{\sys} is a system designed to help users keep track of what
television they want to watch, and in doing so assist in choosing what
to watch when a group gathers together.

A lot of viewer interaction is online, via twitter, facebook, blogs,
or virtual viewing rooms.  However, the level and personal depth of
this social interaction is often questionable.  {\sys} aims to
increase viewers' real life social interaction by making viewing
suggestions based on the group of people gathered together to
watch. This system aims to reduce fights over the television remote,
while using individual and group watching patterns to create more
informative suggestions.

Taking into account the time, location, and shows that you watch with
your friends, {\sys} makes smarter, situational suggestions.  In
addition, {\sys} pulls from the Pandora tagging model to offer more
specialized categories of shows, so that the user can choose what kind
of show that they’re in the mood for.  Borrowing from internet radio’s
“currently listening” queue model, {\sys} has a queue of the shows
you’re currently watching, but allows the viewer to collect and keep
track of shows they might want to watch in the future by storing them
in a special playlist known as a \emph{WatchBox}.
